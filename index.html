            My name is Lindsey and I am 19 years old. I am originally from Darien, Connecticut and I moved to
            North Carolina when I was young. Most of my family lives in the North East and I hope to move back
            one day! I graduated high school from Panther Creek High School in 2017, then went to High Point
            University from 2017-2018. This past year I have been working at lululemon athletica and at a
            Software Development Company in RTP. For fun, I love to workout. I am really passionate about
            fitness. I played competitive tennis growing up and competed in track/xc. I do CrossFit now,
            and I love it!
